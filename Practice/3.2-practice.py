#Remember George Boole layed the ground work of boolean algebra worked on logic and math and basis for binary systems
#you only get true or false in boolean algebra

#conditional operators
3 == 5 #false
3 >5 #false
5 >= 5 #true

#logical operators
1==1 and 2==2 #both must be true to evaluate true
1==1 or 1==2 #one must be true to evaluate to true
not 1==1 #inverts true if false false if true
